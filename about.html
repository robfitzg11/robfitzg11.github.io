            I am 21 years old currently living on campus at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/">
            The University of Rhode Island. </a> I am 
            from Cranston, Rhode Island and I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://chsw.cpsed.net"> 
            Cranston High School West </a> in 2016. I 
            went on to get my Associates degree in General Studies with a concentration in Business 
            from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ccri.edu"> Community College of Rhode Island </a> 
            in 2019. I started attending URI in fall 2019 
            and I am planning to graduate by the end of 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. I 
            am considering a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/minor-programs/computer-science/"> 
            minor in computer science </a> and this class is the first programming class 
            I have ever taken.

            My hobbies include cars, sports and video games. My family
            has many vehicles as we are all car enthusiasts, you can
            see two of them to the right. My dad, brother, and I work
            on our project cars every weekend. I was an athlete in high
            school who participated in track & field and wrestling. My love for sports goes beyond
            just that as I also follow NFL Football and NHL Hockey very closely. When I'm not
            working on school work, our cars, or watching sports, you can find me on Xbox playing
            Call of Duty or NHL '20.

            The love of my life is our one-year-old Shih Tzu puppy named
            Shelby. She is currently living with my dad back home in
            Cranston. She is a sweet girl that just wants to give everyone love. She loves playing with her
            toys and going for long walks, and if we take her off of her leash, she doesn't even try to run
            away. She's such a good girl!
